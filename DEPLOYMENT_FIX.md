# Playwright Browser Installation Fix

## Problem
The application was failing with the error:
```
Executable doesn't exist at /ms-playwright/chromium-1091/chrome-linux/chrome
```

This happens when Playwright browsers are not properly installed in the Docker container.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Dockerfile
- Added explicit browser installation with verification
- Added `playwright install-deps chromium` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Added verification steps to confirm browser installation
- Added the verification script to the build process

### 2. Updated Requirements
- Downgraded Playwright from 1.40.0 to 1.39.0 for better stability
- This version is known to work well in Docker containers

### 3. Added Verification Script
- Created `check_playwright.py` to verify installation
- This script checks:
  - Browser directory existence
  - Chrome executable presence
  - Playwright package import
  - Browser launch capability

## Deployment Steps

1. **Rebuild the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t wishya-app .
   ```

2. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 wishya-app
   ```

3. **Deploy to Render:**
   - Push changes to your repository
   - Render will automatically rebuild with the new Dockerfile
   - The build will fail if Playwright browsers are not properly installed

## Verification

The build process now includes verification steps:
- Browser installation verification
- Chrome executable check
- Playwright functionality test

If any step fails, the build will fail, preventing deployment of a broken image.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check the build logs** for any verification failures
2. **Run the verification script locally:**
   ```bash
   python check_playwright.py
   ```
3. **Check browser paths:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /ms-playwright/
   find /ms-playwright -name chrome -type f
   ```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are set in the Dockerfile:
- `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/ms-playwright`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=false`

These ensure Playwright knows where to find the browsers and doesn't skip the download.
